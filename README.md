### 🚀 Projects & Interests

- 🧠 **AI Mental Wellness Companion**  
  A generative AI bot that detects user emotion from journal entries and conversations. Suggests personalized music (Spotify), mindfulness exercises, and mood-aligned responses. Built using GPT-4, LangGraph, journaling workflows, and prompt engineering.

- 🔊 **Voice Modulator & Emotion Detection** *(WIP)*  
  Built using ESPnet, this tool modifies vocal characteristics and detects emotional tone in real-time. Focused on expressive voice integration in AI agents and gaming systems.

- 🎮 **Air Dash** – Gesture-Controlled Unity Game  
  A 2D platformer controlled by real-time hand gestures using Python-based gesture recognition. Fuses computer vision with Unity to create immersive physical gameplay.

- ⚙️ **Generative AI Tools & LLM Prototypes**  
  Experimental utilities built using Bolt AI, LangGraph, and LM Studio — including local LLM orchestration, agent workflows, and rapid prototyping of AI interactivity.
